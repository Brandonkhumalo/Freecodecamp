## 🧪 Projects Completed

1. **Arithmetic Formatter**  
   Format a list of arithmetic problems into a vertically arranged display.

2. **Time Calculator**  
   Add a duration to a start time and return the final time.

3. **Budget App**  
   Create a class-based budgeting app that tracks spending and generates charts.

4. **Polygon Area Calculator**  
   Write classes to calculate area and perimeter of geometric shapes.

5. **Probability Calculator**

## 🚀 Final Thoughts

Completing this course significantly boosted my confidence in writing Python code for scientific and general-purpose tasks. The hands-on projects were particularly helpful in solidifying my understanding of object-oriented programming, working with functions, and writing readable and efficient code.

I'm excited to continue my Python journey and explore data analysis, automation, and web development next.
